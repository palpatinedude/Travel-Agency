 Facilitate the management of a tourism system. The SQL code establishes a relational database schema, enabling the storage and organization of data related to administrators, tour guides, trips, reservations, and other essential aspects of the tourism industry. It defines the structure for adding, updating, and retrieving information about these entities, such as user details, trip schedules, and reservation records. On the other hand, the GUI code creates a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to interact with the database. It provides a user-friendly platform for administrators and staff to input and retrieve data, simplifying tasks such as booking trips, updating guide information, or managing reservations.
